## Projects 🚧

### 1. Football Lineup Optimization
- **Description:** Developed a football lineup analysis system to suggest optimal strategies based on opponent playstyles using player data.
- **Details:** Took data from the last four La Liga seasons from fbref.com. Tasks included data cleaning, merging datasets, and implementing models such as:
  - Goals and assists prediction.
  - Clustering analysis for insights like workload vs. minutes played.
  - Generating "Best XI" models for each season.
  - Player classification using Gradient Boosting (e.g., workhorse, playmaker).
  - Match win probabilities based on historical data and player performance.
- **Technologies:** Python, Gradient Boosting, pandas, scikit-learn, data visualization tools.

### 2. Job Vacancies Dashboard for Jordan
- **Description:** Created a Power BI dashboard during a data science hackathon to help Jordan's youth find job opportunities.
- **Details:** Processed an Arabic dataset by translating it to English using Azure's Translate API and Python. Reduced dataset complexity by removing irrelevant columns. The dashboard visualizes job availability by district, enterprise size, and job roles.
- **Technologies:** Power BI, Azure Translate API, Python.

### 3. Sign Language Recognition using LSTM
- **Description:** Implemented a deep learning model (LSTM) to recognize sign language gestures. The model converts sign language gestures into text.
- **Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow, LSTM, pandas, OpenCV 🧠

### 4. College Management Chatbot
- **Description:** Developed a chatbot using natural language processing (NLP) to assist with college management tasks. The chatbot can answer queries, provide information about courses, and more.
- **Technologies:** Python, NLTK, Dialogflow, tkinter, neural networks, JSON 🐍
- **GitHub Repository:** [Link](https://github.com/Mihirchauhan0709/chatbot-for-collage-management) 🔗

## Published Research 📄
- **Title:** *Yoga Pose Estimation and Correction*
- **Description:** Published a paper on my final year Bachelor's project about yoga pose estimation and correction. The project involved using Google's MoveNet Thunder model for pose estimation and training a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) to achieve 96% accuracy.
- **Publication Link:** [Read the Paper](https://journals.stmjournals.com/joosdt/article=2024/view=161704/)

## Education 📚
- **Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering**, Mumbai University (2020-2024).
